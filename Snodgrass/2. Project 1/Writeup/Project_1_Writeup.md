# Numeric Integration Project

## Explanation of the code

### Trapezoid approximation

### Legendre polynomial orthogonality

### Gaussian quadrature

## Extras


## Attribution

- People
  - Dr. Reid answered several clarifying questions throughout the project. Mostly, questions about his intent for our work and the form of our submissions. 
- Websites
  - A few different websites were referenced for coding syntax and function definitions
- Books
  - Who has books anymore?!
- AI
  - Much more modern approach. I asked ChatGPT on several occasions to suggest Python functions and to explain their results; such as condensing plots, formatting graphs, and loop syntax...

## Timekeeping

After the full write-up and extensions are finished, the total time spent will be at least a full day's work. 

## Languages, Libraries, Lessons Learned

### Languages
- English mainly, but also Python. I would use C++ or C, but I don't have much experience with Python, and I think it would be good to get some exposure to it. At some point though, I would like to do it in C++ to refine my proficiency
- I started with Python and never thought about switching.

### Libraries
- I used the standard libraries for math-type coding: 
  - NumPy 
  - SciPy
- I also had to use:
  - matplotlib.pyplot
  - SciPy. Special for the Legendre functions
- There was a REMARKABLE library. I pointed this out in the code as well, but the sp.specail.roots_legendre(N) function was AWESOME! It practically completed the most intense part of the algorithm for me. 
- The pyplot library was difficult to use because I have not had much experience with it, and I don't know the syntax. Typically, that is not a big deal, but for a plotting function, there are a lot of steps and customizations that go into it. 
### Lessons learned
- I got more familiar with the syntax of Python, the libraries and their uses, and some functions for math, plotting, etc. 
- Obviously, I learned about Gaussian quadrature and what a wonderful method of integration it is!
- More interestingly than the program-specific topics, I had to practice program management, timekeeping, version control software, git-specific nuances, and more. I think that this project was a great learning curve for the rest of the course.
