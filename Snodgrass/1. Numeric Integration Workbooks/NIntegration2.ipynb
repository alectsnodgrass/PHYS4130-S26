    "Fortunately, people have been working on numerical integration for a long time and have several more advanced methods.  Often, it's not worth reinventing the wheel, and it's better to simply call an already written _library_ function.  In scipy, we can use the `quad` function for this -- it's found in the `scipy.integrate` module.\n",
