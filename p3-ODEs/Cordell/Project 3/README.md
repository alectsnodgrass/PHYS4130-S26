# Introduction
Numerical methods can be implemented to approximate solutions for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that would otherwise be a computationally labor-some task. This package was developed to demonstrate the capabilities of several approximation techniques which include Euler's method, the Runge-Kutta technique, Verlet integration, and Scipy's ODEINT. We provide phase-space and Energy vs Time plots to illustrate their approximation capabilities and ability to conserve energy. By the same token, we plot and analyze the relative error of each method. We found that the Verlet method reaches a 5% relative error within 64 time steps, whereas RK2, RK4, and ODEINT reach the target error within 128 time steps, and Euler's method requires about 2048 time steps. The pros and cons of each method depending on the situation are further discussed in the report.
## Background Theory

Euler's method is typically what one would start out with when exploring ODE approximation methods. It approximates the solution of an ODE at a point, B, by starting from an initial value, point A, and taking the next point B on the tangent line to the solution at point A. Then, it repeats the process for the subsequent points as depicted in Fig. 1. The error of this technique reduces with a larger number of points.

The Runge-Kutta method is similar to Euler's method in the sense that it is an iterative technique; however, it incorporates averaging which makes it far more precise than Euler's method. For example, RK4 approximates the slope using a weighted average of the tangent line at point A, point B and their midpoint. 

Verlet integration can be implemented for second order ODE's of the form $\ddot{x}(t) = A(x(t))$ such as for a harmonic oscillator. The algorithm is derived from the Taylor expansion for $x(t+\Delta t)$ and $x(t-\Delta t)$ as follows,

$$
x(t+\Delta t)=x(t)+\dot{x}(t)\Delta t+\frac{1}{2}\ddot{x}(t)\Delta t^2+\frac{1}{6}x^{(3)}(t)\Delta t^3+\cdots
$$

$$
x(t-\Delta t)=x(t)-\dot{x}(t)\Delta t+\frac{1}{2}\ddot{x}(t)\Delta t^2-\frac{1}{6}x^{(3)}(t)\Delta t^3+\cdots
$$

Adding them yields

$$
x(t+\Delta t)=2x(t)-x(t-\Delta t)+\ddot{x}(t)\Delta t^2+\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^4)
$$

Scipy's ODEINT incorporates a bunch of stuff it seems...

        x1 = x_array[it] + v_array[it]*dt + 0.5 * deriv(x_array[it], v_array[it]) * dt**2
        v1 = v_array[it] + 0.5 * (deriv(x_array[it], v_array[it]) + deriv(x1, v_array[it])) * dt
        x_array[it+1] = x1
        v_array[it+1] = v1


    return t_array, x_array, v_array

The verlet solver does this basically
$$
x_1 = x_0 + v_0\,\Delta t + \frac{1}{2}A(x_0)\,\Delta t^2,
$$

$$
x_{n+1} = 2x_n - x_{n-1} + A(x_n)\,\Delta t^2.
$$



## subsection
What ODE's did we test these on? Exponential decay... SHO with and without a linear dampening...

What did we look at to analyze the methods?

Phase space...

Energy (Hamiltonian)... (is energy conserved basically). State the relationship between energy conservation and phase space area.

Relative error vs time... (maybe also pick some reasonable tmax and compare the error at tmax)

We used these methods to solve ODEs for exponential decay and harmonic oscillation with and without a linear dampening term. We then plotted the phase-space diagrams for each method and compared their relative errors computed using the analytic solutions to the equations. As far as relative error goes, we plotted the relative error over time for each method as well as compared the relative errors between the methods at a chosen time point. Additionally, we created Energy vs. Time plots for each method, to show whether or not energy is conserved.

# Analysis

Import Figures and talk about precision, accuracy, (error and efficiency). Why does Euler's method drift? Error accumulates.
 [plot of Euler's method vs analytic] caption: the error accumulates with more time steps 

... RK method is a step above... higher order RK method is better but more computer work required... 
[RK2 vs RK4 plot] caption: notice that RK2 and RK4 are not very different for nts range.  

... Scipy's odeINT. Talk about ease of use. seems to yield the least relative error.

Verlet method: The special thing about the verlet method is that it conserves energy over time as shown in fig.
[insert figure of energy vs time for verlet method]
